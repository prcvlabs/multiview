This text  file  lists  optional  3rd-party  components  included  in  the
ALGLIB for C++, their functionality and special licensing terms  (if there
are any). If you decide  not  to  use  these  optional  components,  their
licensing terms do not apply to you.

=== COMPONENT 1 ==========================================================

LOCATION:       /cpp/mkl-windows
                /cpp/mkl-interface
DESCRIPTION:    Intel MKL extension for ALGLIB
COPYRIGHT BY:   Intel Corporation
SPECIAL TERMS:  see below

MKL extension for ALGLIB is a special lightweight  distribution  of  Intel
MKL software library which is used to accelerate linear algebra  and  some
other ALGLIB functions. It also includes thin wrapper developed by  ALGLIB
Project, which is used to connect MKL and ALGLIB. This extension  includes
only those MKL functions which are used by ALGLIB.

ALGLIB Project owns a license from Intel which allows our customers to use
MKL as part of ALGLIB without paying additional fees  to  Intel. Its usage
is mostly covered by ALGLIB License Agreement, but there is one  important
additional restriction:

    !
    ! ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS:
    !
    ! you should use our MKL distribution  ONLY  TO ACCELERATE ALGLIB
    ! and ONLY AS PART OF THE ALGLIB. You should not directly use MKL
    ! binaries which are  shipped  with  ALGLIB.  It  is  technically
    ! possible to directly work with mkl4alglib_32/64.dll, but  it is
    ! strictly  prohibited  by  both  Intel MKL  license  and  ALGLIB
    ! license agreement.
    ! If you want to work with Intel MKL, and not  with  ALGLIB,  you
    ! should buy separate license from Intel.
    !

This component should be used as add-on, i.e. if  you  want  to accelerate
ALGLIB functions relying on Intel MKL (which is usually indicated in their
comments), you should link this add-on with the rest of ALGLIB  and define
several  preprocessor  symbols  (see  /cpp/mkl-windows/info.txt  for  more
technical information).
