This directory contains MKL extensions for ALGLIB.

ALGLIB may utilize Intel MKL to speed-up some  calculations.  It  may  use
already existing MKL installation  or special lightweight MKL distribution
which is shipped with  Commercial Edition  of  ALGLIB  and  includes  only
those MKL functions which are used by ALGLIB.

ALGLIB Project owns license for Intel MKL, which allows us to redistribute
MKL  static/dynamic  libraries.  Thus, you may use Intel MKL  to  speed-up
ALGLIB without buying separate license from Intel!

NOTE:      current version of ALGLIB features Windows-only MKL extensions,
           but in future ALGLIB releases we will introduce MKL  extensions
           for Linux systems.

IMPORTANT: you should use our  MKL distribution  ONLY TO ACCELERATE ALGLIB
           and ONLY AS PART OF THE ALGLIB. You should not directly use MKL
           binaries which are  shipped  with  ALGLIB.  It  is  technically
           possible to directly work with mkl4alglib_32/64.dll, but  it is
           strictly  prohibited  by  both  Intel MKL  license  and  ALGLIB
           license agreement.
           If you want to work with Intel MKL, and not  with  ALGLIB,  you
           should buy separate license from Intel.

This directory includes following files:
* ALGLIB-specific Intel MKL distribution - mkl4alglib_32/64.dll
* import library mkl4alglib_32/64.lib for Intel MKL.

In order to use MKL extensions, you should:
* read 'Linking with Intel MKL' section of ALGLIB Reference Manual.
* compile ALGLIB source files with following preprocessor symbols  defined
  on at global level:
  * AE_OS=AE_WINDOWS (to activate multithreading capabilities)
  * AE_CPU=AE_INTEL  (to use SSE instructions provided by x86/x64 CPU's)
  * AE_MKL           (to use Intel MKL functions in ALGLIB)
  If you compile from command line, you may write
      "/DAE_OS=AE_WINDOWS /DAE_CPU=AE_INTEL /DAE_MKL"
* depending  on  CPU  architecture, choose 32-bit or 64-bit  LIB  file   -
  mkl4alglib_32/64.lib - and link it with your application.
* place mkl4alglib_32/64.dll into directory where it can  be  found during
  application startup (usually - application dir)

If you bought separate license for Intel MKL, and want  to  use  your  own
installation  of  MKL  -  and  not our lightweight distribution - then you
should perform all steps above except for linking with  mkl4alglib  static
and dynamic libraries.

Instead of linking  with  mkl4alglib,  you  should  add  to  your  project
mkl4alglib.c file from mkl-interface directory and compile it (as C  file)
along with the rest of ALGLIB.

This C file implements interface between MKL and ALGLIB. Having this  file
in your project and #defining AE_MKL preprocessor  definition  results  in
ALGLIB using MKL functions.

However, this C file is just interface! It is your responsibility to  make
sure that C/C++ compiler can find MKL headers, and appropriate MKL static/
dynamic libraries are linked to your application.

NOTE:      if you link ALGLIB with your own installation if Intel MKL, you
           may do so on any OS where MKL works - Windows or Linux.
